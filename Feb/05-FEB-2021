Relational database management system:-
We store the data in Relational Database Management System in a data structure called "Table". Tables are defined with columns in which we store the data interms of Tuples/records. 
We should not store all of the application data in one single table, because we run into data anamolies, here anomolies means problems in managing the data.
identify different groups of data and store them separately into different tables.
